   >Error claiming interface 0
    Another program or driver has claimed the interface

2. Audacity may not work with this device on some Linux distrobutions  (It works on Windows and Ubuntu Mat 16.04.2 for Raspberry Pi, desn't work on Deepin Linux 15.04). Its sample rate can be 16000 Hz and 32000 Hz. Make sure you set the sample rate to 16000Hz or 32000Hz befor recording. If failed to record anything, re-plug the device and try again.
